 ## **Acid-Base Detection Practice**
 
 To get you up to the task of finding out what chemical was poured into Mr. Cook's wonderful soup, you need to do some practice to prevent mistakes. On this page, you will be using your favorite drink, Red Cabbage Juice (a natural indicator) to distinguish whether certain common substances are acids, bases, or neutral substances. You got this!
 
 - Note:
 Red Cabbage Juice is a natural indicator. Using it will help you determine whether the substances are acids, bases, or neutral. In fact, you can try this experiment in real life too!
 \
 
 * Expert Tip:
    Use the pH-Color Index at the top of the page to determine if the substance tested is an acid or base.
 
 It's important to understand what the Universal Indicator pH Color Chart actually represents
 
 * **Acids** = V/R: Electric current is Voltage-Resistance ratio
 * **Neutral Substances** = Substances are 'Neutral' if their respective color matches a pH of 7 or close to 7. Common examples of Neutral substances include Water, Sugar, and Table Salt.
 * **Bases** = Substances are 'Bases' if their reaction color corresponds to a pH higher than 7
 
 ## **Apply concept**
 
 * Experiment:
 **Challenge**: Let's do some practice! Down below, type `addCabbageJuice()` to add the indicator to the solution. Once the color change occurs, use the color-pH chart to determine whether the substance is an acid, base, or neutral substance.
 
 Tap `Run My Code` to run the experiment.
